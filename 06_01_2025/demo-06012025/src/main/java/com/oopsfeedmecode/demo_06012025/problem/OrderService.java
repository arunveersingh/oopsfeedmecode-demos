    /**
     *     If we need to switch to a different payment processor, weâ€™ll have to modify the OrderService code.
     *     This violates the Open/Closed Principle by making OrderService dependent on specific implementations
     *     instead of being open to extension through abstractions.
     *     It also risks violating the Liskov Substitution Principle if different processors require special
     *     handling or introduce behavior not conforming to the shared contract.
     *
     *     Testability Issues: Imagine a situation if you and your peer are working on this requirement in parallel.
     *     You have to unit test this class; but Payment processor class is still not complete so your peer is hesitant
     *     committing it in the repo.
     *
     *     Reduced Extensibility: Adding features like multi-payment processors requires significant refactoring.
